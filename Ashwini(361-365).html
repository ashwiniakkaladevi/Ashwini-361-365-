                     <i>Recent attention has turned to the healthcare industry and its use of voluntary<br>
                        community health information network (CHIN) models for e-health and care delivery.<br>
                       This chapter suggests that competition,economic dimensions,political issues,and a<br>
                        group of enablers are the primary determinants of implementation success. Most<br>
                        critical to these implementations is the issue of data management and utilization. Thus,<br>
                        health care organizations are finding value as well as strategic applications to mining<br>
                        patient data, in general, and community data, in particular. While significant gains can<br>
                        be obtained and have been noted at the organizational level of analysis, much attention<br>
                        has been given to the individual, where the focal points have centered on privacy and<br>
                        security of patient data. While the privacy debate is a salient issue, data mining (DM)<br>
                        offers broader community-based gains that enable and improve healthcare forecasting,<br>
                        analyses, and visualization</i><br>

                        <p>In this chapter, I provide general insight into data mining with emphasis on the<br>
                            health care industry. My discussion focuses on earlier electronic commerce health care<br>
                            initiatives, namely community health information networks (CHINs) in three regions of<br>
                            the United States. From my exploration of the implementation issues that impacted the<br>
                            success of each case, I offer Figure 1 to illustrate a cluster of factors that capture the<br>
                            dynamics of these live scenarios.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;While my prior work (Payton & Ginzberg, 2001) focused on the information<br>
                            technology implementation process, here I provide insight regarding the mining of health<br></p>

                            <p>data centered about new e-health models of care delivery. One such model for health care<br>
                                was the CHIN, which was a widely sought after model in the late 1990s, and continues<br>
                                to be widely debated by leading industry groups, such as The Healthy Cities Organiza-<br>tion (http://www.healthycities.org) and the IEEE-USA Medical Technology and Policy<br>
                                Committee (http://www.ieeeusa.org/committees/MTPC).<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;While CHINs were said to enable multiple organizations to share health services<br>
                                data in order to meet common objective(s), ranging from profit maximization to improve-<br>ment of public health conditions and wellness, health care organizations are now<br>
                                deploying e-health strategies to accomplish these goals while garnering data to address<br>
                                community and public health needs. Thus, health care organizations are finding value<br>
                                as well as strategic applications to mining patient data, in general, and community data,<br>
                                in particular. While significant gains can be obtained and have been noted at the<br>
                                organizational level of analysis, much attention has been given to the individual where<br>
                                the focal points have centered about privacy and security of patient data. While the<br>
                                privacy debate is a salient issue, data mining offers broader community-based gains that<br>
                                enable and improve health care forecasting, analyses, and visualization.<br></p>

                               <p>Data mining has often been defined as a “process of extracting previously unknown,<br>
                                valid and actionable information from large databases and then using the information to<br>
                                make critical business decisions” (Cabena, Hadjinian, Stadler, Verhees, & Zanasi, 1998).<br>
                                This definition is based on the premise that an organization can link its myriad sources<br>
                                of data into a data warehouse (to potentially include data marts). Further, these data<br>
                                sources can evolve to a higher degree of analyses to include exploration using on-line<br>
                                analytical processing (OLAP), statistical analyses, and querying. One mechanism that<br>
                                can be used to migrate beyond exploration and permit organizations to engage in<br>
                                information discovery is the Sample, Explore, Modify, Model and Assess (SEMMA)<br>
                                Methodology, as developed by the SAS Corporation (http://www.sas.com). In sum,<br>
                                SEMMA enables its users to: 1) test a segment of data (test data) to be mined for<br>
                                preliminary outcomes; 2) assess this sample data for outliers, trends, etc.; 3) revise the<br>
                                sample data set for model testing, which can include neutral networks, linear regression,<br>
                                and decision trees; 4) evaluate the model for accuracy; and 5) validate the model using<br>
                                the complete data set (Groth, 1998).<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the rationale for mining data is a function of organizational needs and<br>
                                type of firm’s role in the industry. Moreover, researchers (Hirji, 2001; Keim, 2001) have<br>
                                established that data-mining applications, when implemented effectively, can result in<br>
                                strategic planning and competitive advantage. In an effort to minimize the collection and</p>
